# Island Junk — Build Progress & Handoff

**2026-07-09** — Backed the Victoria app end-to-end: FastAPI + Postgres (Render) behind the
approved prototypes, with the calendar write/read loop proven and the crew's whole day
persisting to Postgres. Schema design + open decisions live in `docs/data-model.md`; the
scheduling rules in `island-junk-SPEC-scheduling-and-dispatch.md`.

**Stack:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic + Postgres (Render, connected via `.env`).
Python 3.14. Serves the approved `/prototypes` HTML *untouched* — real DB data is injected
inline as `localStorage` before each page's scripts run, and per-screen "bridges" swap
`localStorage` writes for API calls. Deploy target: Render.

---

## 1. DONE (whole build, verified)

- **Reference-data write-back — RATE SHEET LIVE (2026-07):** the owner's rate-sheet edits now **persist to Postgres**
  (was localStorage-only). `apply_rates` (`sync_handlers.py`, reverse of `build_rates_v1`, owner-only) writes rate_card
  scalars + JSONB substructures and upserts disposal **facilities + materials** (resolves facility name→id, logs
  `disposal_rate_history` on a cost/price change; owner-authoritative reconcile-deletes within a *present, non-empty* list,
  guarded against partial writes). Wired via `ij_rates_v1` in `HANDLERS` + the sync-bridge whitelist. **Verified in-browser**
  (edited "Mixed general" $275→$285 → Postgres → survived reload; owner-guard refuses non-owners; seed restored).
  **Customer write-back LIVE too:** `apply_customers` (`ij_customers_v1`) + `apply_company_customers`
  (`ij_company_customers_v1`) upsert new/edited customers from booking + the commercial-account editor (dedupe on
  phone/email/co, department `accounts[]` persist, **upsert-only — never delete-by-absence** since the injected list is
  thousands of rows). **PM tree write-back LIVE too:** `apply_pm` (`ij_pm_db_v2`) upserts the company→group→building tree,
  matching by DB-uuid id else by name so a re-sync (client uid *or* DB id) never duplicates — verified (nested create,
  round-trip no-dup, edit adds one building, cascade cleanup). **Contracts + area surcharges DONE — cluster COMPLETE:**
  `apply_contracts` (`ij_contracts_v1`, near-1:1 Contract model) + rate-sheet custom customers (`ij_rates_v1.customers[]` →
  Contract `rc_*`, extras kept in `properties`) both persist + round-trip (`build_contracts_v1`, `build_rates_v1.customers`).
  **Area surcharges:** added `area_surcharge.roofing_bin_amount` (migration `d83e4b664737`); the rate sheet's "Bin rental &
  areas" section (`ij_rates_v1.surcharges` + `roofingSurcharges`) now persists via `apply_rates` + emits via `build_rates_v1`;
  `scripts/seed_surcharges.py` seeded Victoria's 8 areas (base + 7; Sooke roofing $35 vs regular $60 preserved). **All
  verified** (surcharge edit, custom-customer + contract round-trip, seed, cleanup). So every owner reference screen —
  rates, disposal, customers, PM, contracts, surcharges — now saves to Postgres.

- **Calendar stack-order spike PROVEN** (`/spike`) — the highest-risk unknown. `orderBy=startTime`
  recovers the manager's manual top-to-bottom stack; the `#`-note rule + headline-time parse added later.
- **Foundation** — brand-tagged base/mixins, config, PIN auth + **owner-only guard** (logic layer). Real login on Render.
- **30 tables** on Render via 11 Alembic migrations (+ maintenance_doc, defect_flag, reminder[+gcal_event_id], area_surcharge[+roofing_bin_amount]): employee, owner_security, device, auth_session,
  colour_map, truck, truck_alert_pref, residential_customer, company_customer, pm_company/group/building,
  job, bin, rate_card, area_surcharge, surcharge_waiver, contract, disposal_facility, disposal_material,
  disposal_rate_history, incident, clock_punch, field_job, weigh_log, yard_processing.
- **Real data seeded** — 75-bin fleet, 15-person roster (PINs `0000` placeholder), Victoria rate card,
  trucks #3–7, colour map (decided scheme), starter colour→truck (Tangerine→3, Peacock→4, Banana→5).
- **Booking engine** — `POST /booking` writes the job + **ONE Sage event to the TEST calendar** (live-calendar
  guard enforced). All 7 lanes wired via `/app/new-booking` + `booking-bridge.js` (Collect + Invoiced browser-verified).
- **Day Board reader** — `GET /day-board` → drops `#` notes → colour→truck → **stack order = route order** →
  headline time. Wired to `/app/day-board` showing live routes. `is_manager_note` + `parse_headline_time` unit-tested.
- **Login + all 18 screens** — `/app` real PIN login → launcher (access-gated tiles) → every screen served via the
  `SCREENS` registry with its DB refs injected. Truck Hub / Bin Registry / crew calculators verified on real data.
- **Reference data from DB** (`app/web/refs.py`): fleet, colour map, bins, employees, rates (+ incidents/clock/
  field-jobs/weigh, None-until-data so screens keep demo until real rows exist).
- **Write-persistence — the whole crew day → Postgres** via generic sync (`/sync`, `sync-bridge.js` on every page)
  + a dedicated yard endpoint: **bins, roster (owner-guarded), incidents, clock in/out, job completion (field_job),
  yard weigh, and the yard-processing rich record** (waste class, stream %, gross/tare/net, dump fee — the disposal
  cost-model input). All verified against Render.
- **Maintenance + reminders persistence + 48h CC-charge reminder LIVE + tested.** Migration `46d1bfdb249d` adds
  3 tables (Render migrated). **Maintenance** (`ij_maint_v2`) persists as one JSONB **doc per brand** (`maintenance_doc`)
  — the whole `{order,m,_v}` verbatim, so the prototype's structure + client-side migrations are untouched.
  **Defect flags** (`ij_fixes_v1` walk-arounds → `defect_flag`): upsert-by-id, closed via `ij_fixes_resolved_v1`.
  **Reminders** (`ij_reminders_v1` → `reminder`): upsert-by-id + "done = removed from list" reconcile, scoped to
  app kinds so it never clobbers owner CC-charge rows. New sync handlers (`apply_maint/fixes/fixes_resolved/reminders`)
  + `sync-bridge.js` whitelist + refs (`build_maint_v2/fixes_v1/reminders_v1`) wired to the maintenance/reminders/truck
  screens. **§9/§11 CC-charge reminder** (`app/reminders/service.py`, refined with Wes): the 48-hour clock starts when the
  owner **SENDS THE INVOICE** (after pickup, sometimes days later) — NOT at drop — and "48h" = **2 working days**
  (`app/core/dates.py` skips weekends + BC stat holidays incl. Boxing Day + Truth & Reconciliation; Fri invoice → Tue).
  Created via `POST /reminders/cc-charge` (`invoice_date` defaults to today) → `kind=cc_charge`, "CC? UNPAID (DATE)…manual";
  owner queue `GET /reminders?kind=cc_charge` + `POST /reminders/{id}/done`. **The charge stays manual** (guardrail §2).
  Booking no longer auto-creates it. **Verified** on Render (blob round-trip, flag add+resolve, reminder reconcile leaving
  CC-charge intact, Fri-invoice→Tue-due, booking makes none, owner check-off, manager 403; all test rows deleted).
- **QuickBooks customer import (§13) — DONE + Victoria data LIVE on Render (2026-07).** `app/customers/qb_import.py`
  parses a **QuickBooks Customer Contact List** in **CSV or Excel** (`.xlsx` via openpyxl; skips the report preamble/BOM;
  **alias-mapped headers**; stitches multi-line billing addresses; **normalizes the multi-number "Phone Numbers" cell to
  the first number** + caps every field to its column length). **Classifier:** an explicit Company column wins; else
  (Wes's real export has none) `infer_kind` — a company keyword/number/`&`/`c/o` ⇒ company, else a ≤3-word name ⇒ person,
  longer ⇒ organisation (catches numbered cos, orgs-with-a-contact, and tokenless orgs). Dedupes on phone/email/name;
  idempotent. Owner-only `POST /customers/import/preview|apply` + `GET /customers/summary`;
  `scripts/import_customers.py "<file>" [--apply]`. **Wes's `Victoria Customers.xlsx` (3,002 rows) imported:
  +2,173 residential, +824 company** (5 dup, 0 unusable); `build_customers/company/pm` refs now serve them to the
  booking screen (verified). *(The .xlsx is git-ignored — the PII lives only in Postgres.)* Still open: demo
  `QB_CUST/QB_COMM` consts coexist in the booking screen (see §2); PM tree isn't in a contact list (stays app-entered).
- **Disposal cost model LIVE** — `scripts/seed_disposal.py` seeds Victoria's **7 facilities + 24 materials + 24
  rate-history rows** (from `island-junk-rate-sheet-v14.html`, idempotent, every material FK'd to a facility).
  `app/yard/disposal.py::compute_load_margin` turns a `yard_processing` load into a margin: customer charge =
  headline `waste_class` price × net tonnage; our cost = the class's own `cost` × tonnage (pass-through) **or**
  Σ(stream% × tonnage × stream cost) for a blank-cost Yard-sort class; margin = charge − cost. Costs pulled **live**
  from the registry (edit a rate once → re-prices everywhere). `build_rates_v1` now emits the real facilities/disposal
  into `ij_rates_v1`. Owner-only `GET /disposal/margins` reads it. **Verified end-to-end** on Render (POST yard load →
  margins showed charge 550 / cost 208 / margin 342; streams + explicit + label-normalization + no-weight + unknown-class
  paths all checked; test row deleted). **Model confirmed w/ Wes (2026-07):** the **mixed** rates ($275 <50% wood /
  $245 ≥50% wood) are what **we charge** at our yard (Yard-sort, blank cost); the clean/dirty wood ($80/$110) + all other
  sorted rates are what **we pay** at the landfills. The `rate-sheet` screen (`island-junk-rate-sheet-v14.html`) is now
  registered + served with the real `ij_rates_v1` so the owner sees/edits it live.

---

## 2. IN FLIGHT (loose ends, nothing mid-edit)

- ~~**QuickBooks demo-const suppression**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-07):** `booking-bridge.js::retireDemoCustomers` empties the
  const `QB_CUST` (4) + `QB_COMM` (5) demo arrays in place once real customers are injected, and sets `ij_comm_seeded_v1`
  so `commLoad()` never merges the demo back (which would also sync it). Browser-verified: only the 2,173 residential +
  824 company real customers show, no demo merged into localStorage or the DB.
- **Yard waste-class picker still hardcoded** — the disposal cost model is live, but the yard-processing screen's
  `WASTE_CLASSES` list (13 labels) is still a hardcoded array that *overlaps but ≠* `disposal_material.m` (24 rows).
  The compute reconciles the two via `WASTE_CLASS_ALIAS` + whitespace normalization, but two picker labels have **no
  registry material** (`Mixed drywall (≥31%)`, `Concrete/clay tile`) → a load booked under those returns
  `cost_basis:"unknown"` with a warning. The proper fix (flagged in `docs/data-model.md`) is to drive the picker from
  the materials registry so there's one source. Deferred — needs a careful yard-screen edit.
- **Booking lanes 3–7** (bins, pm, contracts, custom, pallet) — wired by the *generic* bridge (keys off `curType`),
  but only Collect + Invoiced were browser-clicked. Should spot-check each lane's modal in a browser.
- **Yard `#wDone` literal-click** — the save path (`/yard-processing`) is proven from the real page, but the crew/truck
  fields are sheet-closure state, so I set the record as `grab()` would and POSTed via the bridge's exact path rather
  than clicking through the full sheet. A real end-to-end click-through is untested.

---

## 3. NEXT (in order)

1. **Browser verification — DONE (2026-07):** clicked through the real app: **login** (PIN → `/auth/login` →
   access-gated launcher ✓), **reminders** (typed → sync-bridge → Postgres → survives reload ✓), **yard-processing full
   `#wDone`** (bin 12-09 → `/yard-processing` → Postgres → disposal margin $342 ✓ — the flagged-untested flow),
   **maintenance hub** (fleet + due-status ✓), and a **full Bins booking end-to-end** (fill → CREATE JOB → "Book it" →
   `/booking` → job row + **Sage** event colorId 2 on the TEST calendar → cleaned up ✓). **Owner all-access DONE (Wes):**
   `build_employees_v1` grants the owner the full `ACCESS_FLAGS` set, and `main-hub-bridge.js` unlocks the PIN-gated hubs
   (Manager Hub) for the owner only (verified: owner opens Manager Hub directly, no PIN). **Booking-bridge fix:**
   `customerFor` now maps the Bins/Pallet lanes' `binCust`/`palCo` (customer was dropped before). All test rows + TEST
   calendar events deleted.
2. **Integrations** — first outbound: Twilio booking-confirmation text OR a Square payment link on the job
   (see `island-junk-SPEC-sms-and-texting.md` for the shared send-only updates line). Then the **off-board Google
   reminder-calendar mirror** for CC-charge reminders (write-only to a dedicated reminder calendar — needs its id, §4).
3. **Drive the yard waste-class picker from the disposal registry** (retire the hardcoded `WASTE_CLASSES` — see §2).
4. **Confirm QB import vs Wes's real export** + retire the `QB_CUST/QB_COMM` demo consts (see §2).

---

## 4. OPEN DECISIONS (waiting on Wes)

- **Bin truck's real dispatch number/label** — prototype's "12" is demo; not seeded (`scripts/seed_bins.py`).
- **Real unique PINs for the crew** — all seeded `0000`; owner must set real PINs before crew can log in.
- **Nanaimo-leased bins brand** — the 11 ROSS bins are seeded `brand=victoria` with `leased=True`; when the Nanaimo
  workspace is built, decide whether they move to `brand=nanaimo`.
- **Access-flag canonical list** + the orphan `reminders` flag — proposed in `docs/data-model.md`; confirm.
- **Missing file** — `island-junk-nanaimo-setup-rates-v1.html` is referenced but not in the repo (only its store shape).
- **June-2026 expanded palette** — classic palette has only 3 hand-load colours, so only 3 hand-load trucks can run
  distinctly; the full 24-colour set is needed to colour all of #3–7.
- **Spec §4 `#3 truck` example** — reads like a typo for `Truck #3`; implemented the plain leading-`#` = note rule.
  Confirm (see `app/dispatch/calendar_read.py::is_manager_note`).
- **Disposal stream→cost mapping** (`app/yard/disposal.py::STREAM_MATERIAL`) — streams costed at what we PAY at the
  landfill: junk→"General refuse (sorted)" $160, **wood→"Clean wood" $80**, drywall→"Drywall — clean/tested new" $415,
  concrete→"Clean concrete" $41, metal→$0 (income), recycle→"Cardboard" $0. **Wood (Wes 2026-07):** clean = bare lumber
  $80/t; treated/dirty (painted/stained/treated) = $110/t. Kept clean $80 as the default since the yard form has one
  "wood %"; if mixed-load wood is usually treated, flip the map to $110, or split the stream clean-vs-treated (form change).
- **Two waste-class picker labels have no priced material** — `Mixed drywall (≥31%)` and `Concrete/clay tile` aren't in
  the 24-row registry, so loads under those can't be margin-costed. Add the missing material rows, or map them.
- **QuickBooks export format — RESOLVED (2026-07):** Wes's real `Victoria Customers.xlsx` has **no Company column** (cols:
  Customer, Phone Numbers, Email, Full Name, Billing/Shipping Address). Handled via `infer_kind` (keyword/number/name-shape)
  + xlsx support + phone normalization; imported 2,173 residential / 824 company. Residual: a handful of tokenless
  businesses may land in residential — the owner can fix in-app. To re-classify wholesale later, clear `src='qb'` rows and
  re-import (dedupe skips existing, so it won't reclassify in place).
- **CC-charge reminder — LIVE incl. calendar mirror + VERIFIED (2026-07):** 48h = 2 working days, invoice-triggered (above).
  The **off-board Google reminder-calendar mirror is live** — calendar "CC Charge Reminders"
  (`c_139129…@group.calendar.google.com`, in `config.google_reminder_calendar_id`) is now **shared with the service account**
  `ij-calendar-spike@island-junk-spike.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. A new CC-charge reminder creates an all-day **Flamingo**
  event on the due date; marking it paid (`POST /reminders/{id}/done`) recolours it **purple/Grape** (colorId 3).
  `app/integrations/gcal.py` `create/recolor/delete_reminder_event` are guarded to that calendar ONLY (dispatch + TEST
  hard-refused, both directions). **Verified end-to-end on the real calendar** (create→Flamingo, paid→purple, delete; test
  event removed). Mirror is best-effort (reminder saves in-DB even if the calendar is unreachable). Still needs a UI
  "start 48h clock" button at invoice time; if a reminder is ever created while the calendar is down, a back-fill is TODO.
- *Resolved this session (in docs/data-model.md):* Flamingo = residential unpaid (CC **or** e-transfer), status-only;
  bin truck = Graphite/Blueberry; Tomato→Flamingo lifecycle; 7 booking lanes; merged bin lifecycle enum; dispatch
  `truck` table separate from a future maintenance `vehicle` table.

---

## 5. GOTCHAS (don't forget)

- **Alembic + shared `brand` enum:** autogenerate emits inline `sa.Enum('victoria','nanaimo', name='brand')` in *every*
  new migration — you MUST hand-edit it to a module-level `postgresql.ENUM(..., name='brand', create_type=False)` and
  reference it, or you get "type brand already exists". New enums: create once with `checkfirst=True` + `create_type=False`
  on columns. (Every migration in `migrations/versions/` shows the pattern.)
- **Owner is `brand=NULL`** (shared across brands). Any brand-scoped employee lookup MUST include brand-null
  (`or_(brand==b, brand.is_(None))`) — otherwise you create a duplicate owner (bug we hit + fixed in `apply_employees`).
- **ORM registry:** `app/models/__init__.py` is intentionally EMPTY (avoids a cycle base→types→enums). Import
  `app.models.all` to register every model; `new_session()` already does. Alembic env + `app.main` import it too.
- **Python 3.14 (bleeding edge):** plain `uvicorn` (not `[standard]`), `psycopg[binary]`, `pbkdf2_sha256` (not bcrypt),
  and `tzdata` (Windows has no tz DB, needed by `zoneinfo` in `gcal.list_events_for_day`).
- **Refs vs sync:** refs inject inline in `<head>` (synchronous, before prototype scripts → no echo); `sync-bridge.js`
  overrides `localStorage.setItem` at end of `<body>` → only *user* writes sync. `reference_bootstrap_script` skips a
  builder returning `None` (no half-empty blobs that break a screen).
- ~~**Booking calc uses a hardcoded `RES` constant**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-07):** `booking-bridge.js::applyRateSheet` now
  mutates the prototype's `RES` (residential loads/min/labour/GST/parking/items) and overrides `binBase`/`binSurFor` from
  the injected `ij_rates_v1` (added to the new-booking screen's ref keys). Owner rate-sheet edits flow to booking estimates
  — browser-verified live (DB full-load 650→700 & Oak Bay surcharge 10→20 showed in the booking, then tracked back on
  restore). Crew calculators already read `ij_rates_v1`.
- **Day board truck lanes** come from `ij_fleet_v1` + `ij_colourmap_v1` (injected from DB) — colour→truck must map to real
  fleet numbers or jobs land on lanes that don't render.
- **Every calendar test creates real TEST-calendar events — always delete them by id afterward.** The guard
  (`app/integrations/gcal.py`) hard-refuses the two live IDs and anything but the configured TEST calendar.
- **Cosmetic only:** Windows console renders `—`/`·`/`≥` as `�` in Bash output (DB stores correct UTF-8); TestClient
  prints a harmless "httpx deprecated" warning (test client only, not the app).

---

## 6. HOW TO RESUME

**Prereqs already in place:** `.env` (Render `DATABASE_URL` + `SESSION_SECRET`), `spike/service-account-key.json`
(Google creds). The Render DB is **already migrated + seeded** — steps 3–4 are only for a fresh DB.

```bash
# from repo root (Windows paths; .venv already exists)
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt         # 1. deps
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "import app.main; print('imports OK')"   # 2. sanity
.venv/Scripts/alembic.exe -c alembic.ini upgrade head               # 3. migrate (head = d83e4b664737)
# 4. seed (fresh DB only, in this order):
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_owner
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_crew
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_trucks
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_bins
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_rates
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_colours
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_colour_trucks
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_disposal
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m scripts.seed_surcharges
# 5. run
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app                    # http://127.0.0.1:8000/app  (login) · /health
```

Login for the demo: **Manager (demo) / PIN 1111** or **Wes (owner) / PIN 4321**.
Preview config: `.claude/launch.json` (server name `api`).

**Safety confirmed still in place:** calendar guard in `app/integrations/gcal.py` (+ `/spike`) refuses the two live
calendar IDs and writes only to the TEST calendar; `.gitignore` protects `.env`, `**/service-account-key.json`,
`**/.venv/`, `spike/out/`.
